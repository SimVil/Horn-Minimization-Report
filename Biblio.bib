While minimizing the number of clauses or the total number of literals is computationally very hard, minimizing the number of distinct bodies is polynomial time solvable.

This problem is the formalization of the problem of knowledge compression for speeding up queries to propositional Horn expert systems, and it is known to be NP-hard. In this paper we present a linear time algorithm which takes a Horn CNF as an input, and through a series of decompositions reduces the minimization of the input CNF to the minimization problem on a“shorter” CNF. The correctness of this decomposition algorithm rests on several interesting properties of Horn functions which, as we prove here, turn out to be independent of the particular CNF representations.},

In this paper we investigate the problem of optimal compression of propositional Horn production rule knowledge bases. The standard approach to this problem, consisting in the removal of redundant rules from a knowledge base, leads to an “irredundant” but not necessarily optimal knowledge base. We prove here that the number of rules in any irredundant Horn knowledge base involving n propositional variables is at most n − 1 times the minimum possible number of rules. Therefore, the quadratic time transformation of an arbitrary Horn production rule base to an equivalent irredundant and prime one (presented in [9]) provides a reasonable approximation algorithm. In order to formalize the optimal compression problem, we define a Boolean function of a knowledge base as being the function whose set of true points is the set of models of the knowledge base. In this way the optimal compression of production rule knowledge bases becomes a problem of Boolean function minimization. In this paper we prove that the minimization of Horn functions (i.e. Boolean functions associated to Horn knowledge bases) is NP-complete.},

The main theoretical results states that a closed, nonredundant cover is a minimum cover. A simple algorithm is presented to compute a minimum cover for F.},

	abstract = {Concept lattices and closed set lattices are graphs with the lattice property. They have been increasingly used this last decade in various domains of computer science, such as data mining, knowledge representation, databases or information retrieval. A fundamental result of lattice theory establishes that any lattice is the concept lattice of its binary table. A consequence is the existence of a bijective link between lattices, contexts (via the table) and a set of implicational rules (via the canonical (direct) basis). The possible transformations between these objects give rise to relevant tools for data analysis. In this paper, we present a survey of lattice theory, from the algebraic definition of a lattice, to that of a concept lattice, through closure systems and implicational rules; including the exploration of fundamental bijective links between lattices, reduced contexts and bases of implicational rules; and concluding with the presentation of the main generation algorithms of these objects.},

They are applied in the theory of relational data bases and in formal concept analysis. Further applications in combinatorics and algebra are foreseeable. The main theorem describes the structure of minimum, respectively optimal, implicational bases of any finite closure space. It has strong corollaries for specific closure spaces, e.g., having a geometric, respectively modular, respectively lower distributive, lattice of closed sets.},

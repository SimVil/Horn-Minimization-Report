\chapter{Introduction and definitions}

This report summarizes the work on the Horn-minimization subject. We first give
mathematical definitions we may need for all the report, the reader may refer 
to \cite{Lat&Ord}, \cite{CExp}. The aim of this chapter is to give various 
aspects of a same object, namely an implication basis. We first go through 
logical definitions, then we move to set theoretic aspect (with closure)

% Chapter II: A review on algorithms for horn minimization
\chapter{Algorithms}

In the first chapter we introduced the aim of our study, our working procedure
and the main tools for us to understand the next explanations. In this part, we
will focus on reviewing the existing algorithms for the Horn minimization task. 


% History / soa of the problem.
% Start from explaining the applications in real life, come to implications, 
% explain the various existing problems, come to ours, explain that it is 
% polynomial, develop the sens of various algorithms in various terminologies.
% Explain (again) that our task is to compare those algorithms in both
% theoretical and practical aspects.

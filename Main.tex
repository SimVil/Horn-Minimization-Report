Before any discussion, I would like to thank people having helped me within this master thesis. First of all, I am deeply grateful to my academic supervisor Mr. Sergei A. Obiedkov for his availability and precious advices, very interesting discussions and above all his patience with me relentlessly knocking at his door.

I am also thankful toward people having given me feedback on this report.

Eventually, since this master thesis is for me a representative of a year studying in Russia, I am thankful to Ekaterina Pavlova and Sergei Kusnetsov for their support, and my friends here, Betty and Irina for memories they contributed to build.

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}

This document is a report of a master thesis made at HSE computer science faculty (Moscow). It has been conducted in the context of a double-diploma program with the ISIMA (France). The topic was implication theories, or Horn, minimization, used in database applications for instance. More precisely the aim was to provide a review of existing algorithms for performing minimization and implement them to see how do they behave under practical test cases.

\vspace{1.2em}

By the end of the period, we found several algorithms and reviewed them within the context of closure systems. On top of providing explanations on their operation and complexity analysis, we implemented those algorithms using C++.
Using randomly generated systems and real data, we determined which closure operator matches the best each algorithm and which algorithm or steps are likely to be used in practice. Those results being valid within the context
of our experiments, suggest further research and experiments to lead in future work.

% Introduction
\input{Chapter/Intro.tex}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}

This document reports a master thesis conducted at the faculty of Computer Science of the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, department of Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence. It took place within the context of double-diploma ISIMA (France)/HSE in the Data Science master programme, second year.

\vspace{1.2em}

The topic during this master thesis was to review and implement several algorithms for implication theories minimization, also known as Horn minimization. Such systems model knowledge deduction through correlation relations known as implications. The aim of algorithms we studied is to minimize the size of those implicational basis while
keeping all the information they provide. Such relations arise in various applications such as formal concept analysis, relational databases, conceptual exploration linguistics or learning spaces for instance. The present
document is relative to a theoretical study, hence applications will not be extensively discussed.

\vspace{1.2em}

To expose our work, we will stick to an outline divided in three chapters. First, we will review the overhaul definition of our problem and mathematical elements we shall need to understand subsequent algorithms. The second part will be dedicated to the review of algorithms we effectively implemented. In
the last chapter, we will focus on implementation of procedures (in C++) and their experimental results in terms of execution time.

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Conclusion}

In this master thesis, we were interested in the problem of implication theories minimization which is: having a system of implications, trying to remove as much elements as possible without altering the knowledge described by
the system. More precisely, we had to review existing algorithms and implement them to see how do they perform under practical computations.

\vspace{1.2em}

To answer this problematic, we first tried to find in literature existing algorithms matching our minimization task. Then we brought to the field of closure spaces and implications some algorithms to study them. In this review, we gave elements of proof and complexity analysis. Because of some difficulties, errors or similarities in algorithms we found, we can still improve our insight on some of them as a perspective of our study.

\vspace{1.2em}

Consequently to this review, and using a code previously developed for FCA and closure computing purposes, we implemented the algorithms we worked on in C++. Next, after setting up a testing framework, we ran tests on implemented procedure. Experiments gave results on the behaviour of algorithms
and their efficiency in practice. We exhibited  possible improvements in the implementation of each procedure and accordingly, difference of speed
for closure operators. We also depicted some practical conclusions on which algorithm to use depending on the case or at least, some step to consider when trying to think of another way to minimize systems with a closure-based approach.

\vspace{1.2em}

Finally, our work opens some possibilities for future research and experiments. One could for instance be interested in studying a better way to handle the structure (notably in terms of redundancy) of randomly generated data as compared to real life datasets. More generally, we could be interested in extending our tests to larger datasets and a broader range of improvements for closure operators to strengthen our hypothesis.

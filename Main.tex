Before any discussion, I would like to thank people having helped me within this master thesis. First of all, I am deeply grateful to my academic supervisor Mr. Sergei A. Obiedkov for his availability and previous advices, very interesting discussions and above all his patience with me relentlessly knocking at his door.

I am also thankful toward people having given me feedback on this report.

Eventually, since this master thesis is for me a representative of a year studying in Russia, I am thankful to Ekaterina Pavlova and Sergei Kusnetsov for their administrative support, and my friends here, Betty and Irina for memories they contributed to build.

This document reports a master thesis conducted at the faculty of Computer Science of the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, department of Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence. It took place within the context of Data Science master programme, second year.

The topic during this master thesis was to review and implement several algorithms for implication theories minimization. Such systems model knowledge deduction through correlation relations known as implications. The aim of algorithms we studied is to minimize the size of those implicational basis while
keeping al the information they provide. Such relations arise in various application such as formal concept analysis, relational databases, conceptual exploration linguistics or learning spaces for instance. The present
document is relative to a theoretical study, hence applications will not be extensively discussed.

\vspace{1.2em}

To expose our work, we will stick to an outline divided in three chapters. First, we will review the overhaul definition of our problem and mathematical elements we shall need to understand subsequent algorithms. The second part will be dedicated to the review of algorithms we effectively implemented. In
the last chapter, we will focus on implementation of procedures (in C++) and their experimental results in terms of execution time.

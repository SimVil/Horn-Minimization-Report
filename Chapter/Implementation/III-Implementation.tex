\section{Test set up}

\subsection{Overhaul framework}

\begin{itemize}
	\item c++, boost, python, matplotlib
	\item code gotten from github
	\item closure, linclosure
	\item csv exportation, bitfiles
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Generating random data}

\subsection{Real data}

In this part we will be interested in application to real datasets. The application we used is FCA since the framework we use is dedicated to FCA
testing. We will first present briefly FCA and its correlation with our
minimization issue, before describing some real datasets we have been using
and their characteristics.

\subsubsection{Introduction to FCA}

Formal Concept Analysis is a technique relying on array-like data and lattices
to describe hierarchies in data. It can be used in data mining, text mining or
chemistry for instance.

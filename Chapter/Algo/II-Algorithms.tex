\chapter{Review of existing algorithms}

In the first chapter we introduced the aim of our study, our working procedure
and the main tools for us to understand the next explanations. In this part, we
will focus on reviewing the existing algorithms for the Horn minimization task. 


% History / soa of the problem.
% Start from explaining the applications in real life, come to implications, 
% explain the various existing problems, come to ours, explain that it is 
% polynomial, develop the sens of various algorithms in various terminologies.
% Explain (again) that our task is to compare those algorithms in both
% theoretical and practical aspects.

\section{Directed graphs and Hypergraphs}

\begin{definition}[\belemp{Hypergraph}] An \belemp{hypergraph} is a pair $H = 
	(V, E)$ 
	where $V$ is a set of vertices (as in a graph) and $E$ a set of subsets of 
	$V$
	describing hyperarcs.
	
\end{definition}

\noindent In fact, hypergraphs are an extension of graphs. 


\begin{definition}[\belemp{Directed Hypergraph}] A \belemp{directed hypergraph} 
	$H = (V, E)$ is a pair with $V$ a set of vertices (nodes) and $E$ a set of 
	elements of $2^V \times 2^V$, denoting edges going from a subset of $V$ to 
	another subset of $V$.
	
\end{definition}

Directed hypergraphs are useful to graphically represent implication basis.

\paragraph{Example} Let us consider the following implication basis $\I$:

\[ \I = \{ 1 \imp 2, 2 \imp 34, 3 \imp 12, 41 \imp 3 \} \]

\noindent Then we can define an hyper graph $L = (V, E)$ where
\begin{itemize}
	\item $V = \{1, 2, 3, 4 \}$
	\item $E = \{ (\{ 1 \}, \{ 2\}), (\{ 2 \}, \{3, 4\}),
	(\{ 3 \}, \{ 1, 2\}), (\{1, 4\}, \{ 3\}) \}$
\end{itemize}

\noindent To be clearer, we can see the graphical representation of this figure
in \ref{fig:DHyp1}

\chapter{Definitions, Framework}

\gls{z}.

In this chapter, we will focus on giving definitions of the mathematical 
objects we may need later. As we shall see, each section giving definitions is 
a different way to represent the same idea. Then, we will introduce the Horn 
Minimization task without any algorithm, to provide the reader with some 
intuition and simple examples of our problem. A more detailed description of 
the minimization task and existing solutions or studies will be given in 
chapter 2.

To be more precise, we develop first the main framework we may use to reason:
closure systems over attribute sets. We will often try to think of various 
algorithms and proofs within this framework to have a red line to follow. Then,
we approach propositional logic and few elements of graph theory. To emphasize
the links between various aspects, we will try to use the same notations on 
equivalent notions.
